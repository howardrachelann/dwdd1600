        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Meet the Artist</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name's <strong>Rachel</strong>, the hands (and heart) behind the nails. I started doing nails as a fun
            creative outlet
            and quickly fell in love with the process—from shaping and prepping to the final top coat. What began as
            doing nails for friends and family turned into a true passion for helping others feel confident and
            put-together. I'm all about fun sets, healthy nails, and a relaxing experience. Whether you're coming in for
            a bold new look or a simple refresh, I want you to leave feeling like your best self.</p>

        <h2>The Nail Standard</h2>
        <p>At the core of everything I do is a commitment to <em>quality, health, and creativity.</em> I believe that
            beautiful nails start with a healthy foundation, which is why I prioritize natural nail care, clean
            techniques, and high-quality products. Every set is done with intention—whether it's a minimalist look or a
            bold design, I aim for precision, durability, and style that fits you. My goal is to create a space where
            you can relax, feel taken care of, and leave with nails you're proud to show off. No shortcuts, no harsh
            drilling—just thoughtful work and good vibes.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A welcoming, clean, and cozy space.</li>
